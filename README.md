# GPTP-For-VS2008
The General Plugin Template Project of Starcraft adapted to Visual Studio 2008

Just some works for Starcraft: Brood War.

**Work done:**

- Starting workers set to 12.
- Workers will harvest at first run.
- Re-worked collision for workers while harvesting (like SCII).
- Window-mode (requires WMODE.dll and WMODE_FIX.dll).
- Changed harvest rates (and could be controlled separately).
- Changed unit-speed behavior and added speed modifier on creep.
- Auto harvest on rally point.
- Target lines.
- Idle worker count.

**To do:**

- Add rally point for zerg-eggs.
- Add code for borrowed movement.
- Add code for different larva amount (3 - hatchery, 4 - lair, 5 - hive).
- Add worker count for CC, Nexus and Hatchery/Lair/Hive.
- Add worker count for Refinery, Assimilator and Extractor.
- Add 12/15 button box (from the 3x3 command box).
- Rework the pathfinding (like SCII pathfinding, based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDH1AZLMZkY ).
- Rework the game layer size (in order to achieve this: http://www.moddb.com/members/kysxd/images/hud-20-wip1 ).

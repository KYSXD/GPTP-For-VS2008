# GPTP-For-VS2008.
--------
The General Plugin Template Project of Starcraft adapted to Visual Studio 2008

Branches
--------

I publish in two rolling branches:

The **[release branch](https://github.com/KYSXD/GPTP-For-VS2008/tree/release)** is extensively tested. I work hard to make releases stable and reliable, and aim to publish new releases every few months.
This branch tracks all the changes i made for *Starcraft V*.

The **[update branch](https://github.com/KYSXD/GPTP-For-VS2008/tree/update)** tracks live changes by [BoomerangAide](https://github.com/BoomerangAide/GPTP-For-VS2008). 
This is the cutting edge and may be buggy.

> **Important**: Note from [BoomerangAide](https://github.com/BoomerangAide)
*-If there are several Update-X branches, the most stable is the one with the lowest value, the less tested (but probably with more experimental features) is the one with the highest value.*

Other short-lived branches may pop-up from time to time as i stabilize new releases or hotfixes.
The current working branch is the
[0.1](https://github.com/KYSXD/GPTP-For-VS2008/tree/0.1).
Take a look for all the new experimental features!
